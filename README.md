You've come here for a reason...


This is Mitchel Hussack's repo. I am a beginner, give me time to make tweaks. 
Hopefully as time goes on I will be faster and better, but for now I'm still most likely working
on DrunkMode, taking hours to write 10 lines of code, making sure I'm not doing anything wrong and 
doing extensive research. If you want to message me, my go-to social media for dev-related things is
Reddit & Twitter (@mitchelhussack). Although you may also email me @ chelartwork@gmail.com. Enjoy!
